# Binary Search Array - Approach

1. **Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the range of elements in the array. Initially, set `left` to 0 and `right` to the last index of the array.

2. **Use a while loop to continue searching as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.**

3. **In each iteration of the loop:**
   - Calculate the middle index `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.

4. **Compare the element at index `mid` with the target element:**
   - If they are equal, return `mid` as the index of the target element.
   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, update `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half of the current range.
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, update `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half of the current range.

5. **If the loop completes without finding the target element, return `null` to indicate that the element is not in the array.**

6. **The binary search algorithm efficiently locates the target element in the sorted array.**
