# Count Leaves in a Tree

## Problem Statement

In this problem, you will implement the `countLeaves` function in a Tree class.

A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges where each node contains a value and may have zero or more child nodes. A "leaf" node is a node that has no children.

The `countLeaves` function should traverse the tree, and return the number of leaf nodes the tree contains.

Implement the `countLeaves` function in the Tree class such that it returns the correct number of leaves in the tree.

### Constraints

- The tree can have any number of nodes, but will always have at least one node (the root).
