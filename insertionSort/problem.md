# Insertion Sort

## Problem Statement

Implement the insertion sort algorithm for an array of objects. The sorting should be stable, meaning that equal elements should retain their relative order. You'll be sorting objects with a `value` field.

## Function Signature

```javascript
/**
 * Insertion sort is a basic sorting algorithm that grows a sorted array behind the current location while iterating over the input array.
 *
 * @function insertionSort
 * @param {Array} array - The input array of objects to be sorted.
 * @return {Array} - Returns the sorted array.
 */
