# Deep Equals

## Problem Statement

Write a function `deepEquals` that, given two objects, returns whether or not the two objects are deeply equivalent. Deep equivalence means that the structure of the two objects is the same, and the structure of each of their corresponding descendants is also the same.

## Function Signature

```javascript
/**
 * Return whether two objects are deeply equivalent.
 *
 * @function deepEquals
 * @param {Object<any>} apple - The first object to compare.
 * @param {Object<any>} orange - The second object to compare with the first object.
 * @return {boolean} - Returns true if the objects are deeply equivalent; otherwise, returns false.
