# Toy Problem: Maximum Contiguous Sum

## Problem Statement

Given an array of numbers, your task is to calculate the greatest contiguous sum of numbers in it. A single array item will count as a contiguous sum.

Write a function `sumArray` that takes an array as input and returns the maximum contiguous sum of numbers in the array.

### Examples

- `sumArray([1, 2, 3])` should return `6`.
- `sumArray([1, 2, 3, -4])` should return `6`.
- `sumArray([1, 2, 3, -4, 5])` should return `7`.
- `sumArray([4, -1, 5])` should return `8`.
- `sumArray([10, -11, 11])` should return `11`.

## Constraints

- The input array can have both positive and negative numbers.
- The array can be empty, but you can assume it will always be an array of integers.
