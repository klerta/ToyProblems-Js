# Hash Table

## Problem Statement

Create a hash table with `insert()`, `retrieve()`, and `remove()` methods. The hashtable does not need to resize but it should still handle collisions.

## Function Signature

```javascript
/**
 * Create a hash table with `insert()`, `retrieve()`, and `remove()` methods.
 * The hashtable does not need to resize but it should still handle collisions.
 *
 * @function makeHashTable
 * @return {Object} - Returns a hash table object with insert, retrieve, and remove methods.
 */
