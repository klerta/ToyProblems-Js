## About

This repository serves as a testament to my coding journey with JavaScript. Inside, you'll discover a wide range of problems, each neatly organized in its own folder. Each problem folder includes:

- `problem.md`: A detailed problem statement.
- `solution.js`: My JavaScript solution(s) to the problem.
- `README.md`: Explanations, thought process, and any optimizations.

Feel free to explore the challenges, review my solutions, and provide feedback if you have any suggestions for improvement. If you're a beginner, this repository can be a valuable resource to learn JavaScript through hands-on practice.
