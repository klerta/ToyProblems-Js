# Async Map - Approach

1. **Initialize an array to store the results of asynchronous tasks.**

2. **Iterate through the array of asynchronous tasks:**
   - For each task, invoke it and provide a task-specific callback function.
   - Inside each task-specific callback function, store the result in the results array.

3. **Track the count of completed tasks.**

4. **In each task-specific callback, increment the count of completed tasks.**

5. **Check if all tasks have completed:**
   - If yes, call the final-result callback with the results array.
   - If not, continue waiting for more tasks to complete.

6. **Return the final results to the final-result callback.**

7. **The final-result callback can now process the results as needed.**
