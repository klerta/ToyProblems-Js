# Longest Run of Identical Characters

## Problem Statement

Write a function `longestRun` that, given a string, finds the longest run of identical characters and returns an array containing the start and end indices of that run. If there are two runs of equal length, return the first one. If the input string is empty, return `null`.

## Function Signature

```javascript
/**
 * Find the longest run of identical characters in a string.
 *
 * @function longestRun
 * @param {String} string - The input string.
 * @return {Array<[Number, Number]> | null} - Returns an array containing the start and end indices of the longest run or null if no run is found.
