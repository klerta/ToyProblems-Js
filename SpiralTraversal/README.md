# Spiral Traversal - Approach

## Problem Statement

You are given a 2-dimensional array, `matrix`, and your task is to traverse this matrix in a spiral pattern, starting from the upper left corner and moving towards the center.

## Approach

1. **Create a function `spiralTraversal`** that accepts a 2-dimensional array `matrix`.

2. **Initialize variables** `startRow`, `endRow`, `startCol`, and `endCol` to keep track of the current boundaries of the spiral traversal.

3. **Initialize an empty array `result`** to store the values in spiral order.

4. **Iterate through the matrix** while updating the boundaries based on the traversal direction:
   - Traverse from left to right (top row).
   - Traverse from top to bottom (rightmost column).
   - Traverse from right to left (bottom row), if applicable.
   - Traverse from bottom to top (leftmost column), if applicable.
   - Repeat these steps until reaching the center of the matrix.

5. **Return the `result` array** containing the values in the spiral order.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the total number of elements in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the `result` array is used to store the values.

By following this approach, you can efficiently traverse a 2-dimensional matrix in a spiral pattern, collecting the elements in the desired order.
