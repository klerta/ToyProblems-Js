# Solution Explanation

In order to solve the "Telephone Words" problem, I have utilized a recursive approach to generate all possible letter combinations given a digit string input.

Here is an outline of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: I created a dictionary to map each digit to its corresponding letters according to a standard telephone keypad.
   
2. **Recursion**:
   - **Base Case**: If the `digitsLeft` array has a length of zero, it means we have reached the end of the digit string, and the current word is pushed to the result array.
   - **Recursive Case**: If there are digits left to be processed, I take the first digit from the `digitsLeft` array and find its corresponding letters from the dictionary. Then, I iterate through each letter, appending it to the `currentWord` and call the function recursively with the updated word and the remaining digits.

3. **Result**: After all recursive calls are finished, we will have all possible combinations stored in the `result` array, which is then returned.
